## 🎯 Philosophical Stance on AI Use

- ChatGPT is viewed as **Augmented Intelligence**—  
  a *thinking companion* in designing structured knowledge, systems, and learning tools.

- Driven by the belief that  
  **“Prompt = Blueprint”** and **“GPT = Reflective Mirror”**,  
  AI is used to translate human intent into **explicit, reusable design structures**.
