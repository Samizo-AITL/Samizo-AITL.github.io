# 🧱 Physical-First Engineering  
## 🧠 Intelligent Control Architecture

### An Integrated Design Philosophy  
### for Semiconductors / Control / AI

## Why Physical-First Engineering?

- AI and control systems are becoming black boxes
- Models and implementations are disconnected
- Semiconductors, control, and AI are discussed separately

👉 Engineering systems require  
**causal and hierarchical structure**

---

## Layered Engineering Architecture

- 🧱 Physics / Devices  
- 📐 Models / Equivalent Circuits  
- 🎛 Control (PID / FSM)  
- 🧠 Intelligence (LLM)

👉 Clear separation of responsibility and time scale

---

## Core Principle

👉 **Intelligence belongs only to the outermost layer**  
👉 Stability is guaranteed by physics and mathematics
