  A template-based control design framework (FSM, PID, LLM) with ChatGPT-assisted Verilog HDL generation

- 🤖 **AITL-H**  
  A three-layer intelligent control architecture: FSM (instinct), PID (reason), and LLM (intelligence)

- 📘 **Edusemi / EduController**  
  Curriculum-integrated PoC platforms in semiconductor and control systems enhanced by GPT

- 🧩 **Project Design Hub (PDH)**  
  A virtualized directory structure unifying educational resources, design artifacts, project logs, and evaluations
