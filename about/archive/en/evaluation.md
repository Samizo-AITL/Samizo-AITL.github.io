# 📊 Evaluation Matrix

This page presents a **relative evaluation matrix** of multiple  
manufacturing-related technical themes.

The original source materials are **non-public** and not included here.  
This matrix focuses exclusively on **evaluation criteria and relative positioning**,  
not on implementation details.

---

## 🎯 Evaluation Criteria (20 points each)

- **Technical Depth**  
  Depth of physical understanding and analytical rigor

- **Manufacturing Applicability**  
  Effectiveness and practicality in real production environments

- **Business Impact**  
  Contribution to cost efficiency, supply continuity, and competitiveness

- **Reproducibility**  
  Applicability to other products, technology generations, or organizations

- **Archival Value**  
  Educational, historical, and structural value as technical documentation
