# 🧩 Engineering Decision Frameworks  
— A Thinking Structure for Sustainable Manufacturing —

This page summarizes the **core engineering decision frameworks**  
extracted and abstracted from non-public manufacturing materials.

While the original cases span different domains, periods, and products,  
they consistently follow a **common structure of engineering judgment**.

This framework is presented as a **reusable thinking model**,  
not as a description of specific implementations.

---

## 🧭 Framework Overview

Engineering decisions in manufacturing are structured into the following  
**five sequential stages**:

1. **Identify physical root causes**
2. **Control variability at the process level**
3. **Close issues through reliability design**
4. **Ensure continuity via redundancy and BCP**
5. **Sustain operations through cost and BOM governance**

> ⚠️ This order is intentional and **must not be reversed**.  
> Each stage depends on the understanding established in the previous one.

## ① Identify Physical Root Causes

The first step is to interpret defects, degradation, and variability  
**in terms of physical mechanisms**, not symptoms.

Typical focus areas include:

- Electrical or functional parameter shifts
- Concentration at materials, interfaces, or edges
- Time-dependent and history-dependent behavior

> Design or process discussions should begin  
> **only after a physical model has been clearly articulated**.

---

## ② Control Variability at the Process Level

Once physical mechanisms are understood,  
the goal is **not to eliminate variability, but to control it**.

- Material variation is treated as a given
- Process parameters are treated as control variables
- Screening, margins, and structural design absorb variability

> The objective is not to select only good units,  
> but to **expose and capture weak units within the process**.

---

## ③ Close Issues Through Reliability Design

All countermeasures must be **validated and closed through reliability evaluation**.

- Initial performance alone is insufficient
- Reproducibility must be confirmed under accelerated conditions
- Failure modes must remain consistent over time

> A permanent solution is one that is  
> **stable across the time axis**.

---

## ④ Ensure Continuity via Redundancy and BCP

Even technically correct solutions are insufficient  
if manufacturing continuity cannot be maintained.

Key principles include:

- Preserve design assets whenever possible
- Achieve equivalence at the process level
- Manage multiple sites and processes under unified criteria

> Redesign is a last resort.  
> **Continuity should first be protected through equivalence**.

---

## ⑤ Sustain Operations Through Cost and BOM Governance

Finally, engineering solutions must be  
**translated into forms that can be sustained operationally**.

This includes:

- Reducing over-specification
- Using BOM as a shared decision-making language
- Converting individual judgment into explicit rules

> Technology is not complete when it is merely correct.  
> **It becomes meaningful only when it can be sustained.**

## 📌 Position of This Framework

- This framework represents an **abstracted thinking structure**
- It contains no case-specific data, numbers, or conditions
- It is not a substitute for the original non-public materials

However,

> It is intended to function as a **reusable template**  
> for future engineering decision-making in manufacturing contexts.

This concludes the **Engineering Decision Frameworks**  
that underpin this technical archive.
