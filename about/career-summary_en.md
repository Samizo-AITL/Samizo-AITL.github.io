📘 **Career Phases**

- **Phase 1｜From Control Design to Semiconductor Devices (1994–2006)**  
  In 1994, as a **senior undergraduate**, he worked on control system design using MATLAB/Simulink.  
  During his graduate studies, he focused on electromagnetic field analysis.  
  After joining Seiko Epson in 1997, he engaged in process integration for 0.35–0.18μm logic, memory, and high-voltage devices.  
  *In 1998, he led the **startup of a 64M DRAM using 0.25μm technology**, handling process development, flow documentation, and failure analysis.*

- **Phase 2｜Piezoelectric Materials and Actuator Development (2007–2012)**  
  He conducted comprehensive analysis of PZT processes for FeRAM, then moved to thin-film piezoelectric (TFP) actuator development.  
  *He identified microbubbles in PZT as the root cause of diaphragm cracking and successfully eliminated them through targeted countermeasures.*

- **Phase 3｜PrecisionCore Commercialization and Education System Design (2012–Present)**  
  As part of the next-generation printhead project "PrecisionCore", he led COF design, reliability assurance, security implementation, and manufacturing rationalization.  
  He also played a central role in **BOM management, process optimization, and ISO training programs**, representing a shift from technical execution to organizational design.
