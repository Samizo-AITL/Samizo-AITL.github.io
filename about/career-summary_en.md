## 🛠️ Career Summary

Shinichi Samizo is an engineer who has advanced from control theory and electromagnetic analysis to semiconductor device development, PZT actuator systems, and the full productization of PrecisionCore printheads—including BOM management and engineering education. His journey represents a **consistent evolution from hands-on technology to system design and knowledge transfer**.

### 📘 Career Phases

- **Phase 1**: Started with control system design using MATLAB/Simulink during graduate school. After joining Seiko Epson, worked on 0.35–0.18µm logic, memory, and high-voltage process integration.

- **Phase 2**: Led extensive analysis on PZT processes for FeRAM, and was responsible for electrical evaluation in thin-film piezo (TFP) actuator development. Identified that membrane cracks—a major reliability issue—were caused by voids within the PZT layer, and successfully implemented measures to eliminate them.

- **Phase 3**: Took a central role in the next-generation “PrecisionCore” printhead project, covering COF design, reliability assurance, security implementation, and cost optimization. Later led BOM management and ISO-based education programs, embodying the **transition from engineer to organizational designer**.

Currently, he leverages this career to develop and deliver the **Samizo-AITL** framework for educational support, prompt engineering, and integrated system design.
