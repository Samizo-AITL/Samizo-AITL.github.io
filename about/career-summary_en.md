📘 **Career by Phase**

- **Phase 1: From Control Systems to Semiconductor Devices (1994–2006)**  
  In 1994, as an undergraduate, he began control design using **MATLAB/Simulink**, and later engaged in electromagnetic field simulation in graduate school.  
  In 1997, he joined Seiko Epson, working on **process integration for 0.35μm to 0.18μm logic, memory, and high-voltage CMOS technologies**.  
  *He led complex integration of transistors with different characteristics, handling process design, implementation, and verification.*

  > 🧩 **Episode: 64M DRAM Startup (1998)**  
  > *Led the mass production ramp-up of a 0.25μm-generation DRAM, covering end-to-end process design, defect analysis, and yield improvement.*
