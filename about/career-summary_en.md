## 📘 Career Phases

### 🔹 Phase 1: From Control Design to Semiconductor Devices (1994–2006)

- **1994**: Began control system design using MATLAB/Simulink as an undergraduate student  
- **Graduate research**: Conducted electromagnetic field analysis on microreactor structures

> 🧪 **Episode: Thin-Film Microreactor Analysis (1996–1997)**  
> Analyzed a microreactor for DC-DC converter applications using ferrite magnetic material and Al spiral coil structure.  
> Provided Q-factor loss evaluations and guidelines for Al/Cu selection in the 500kHz–1MHz frequency range.

- **1997**: Joined Seiko Epson Corporation  
  Led **process integration for logic, memory, and high-voltage devices** in the 0.35–0.18μm technology generations.  
  Managed complex integration of transistors with different characteristics across process design, implementation, and verification.

> 🧩 **Episode: 64M DRAM Ramp-Up (1998)**  
> Participated in the mass production startup of 0.25μm DRAM.  
> Involved in process ramp-up, failure analysis, and yield improvement.
