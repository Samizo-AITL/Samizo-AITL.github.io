üõ†Ô∏è **Career Summary**

Shinichi Samizo is an engineer whose expertise evolved from control theory and electromagnetic analysis to semiconductor device development, PZT actuator engineering, and ultimately to productization of the **PrecisionCore printhead**, BOM management, and educational program design.  
He has consistently deepened his perspective from **technical execution to system design and educational structuring**.

üìò **Career Phases**

- **Phase 1**: Started with control system design using MATLAB/Simulink during graduate school. After joining Seiko Epson, he worked on integration of 0.35‚Äì0.18Œºm logic, memory, and high-voltage processes.
  
*In 1998, he led the **ramp-up of 64M DRAM based on 0.25Œºm node technology**. As a device engineer, he was responsible for process design, flow sheet deployment, and failure analysis.*

- **Phase 2**: Conducted comprehensive analysis of PZT process characteristics for FeRAM. In the thin-film piezo (TFP) actuator project, he identified internal PZT voids as the cause of diaphragm cracking‚Äîa critical thin-film issue‚Äîand implemented successful countermeasures.

- **Phase 3**: Played a leading role in the next-generation "PrecisionCore" printhead project, driving COF design, reliability assurance, security implementation, and design rationalization. He also led BOM management and ISO training programs, embodying the **evolution from engineer to systems and organizational designer**.

Currently, he is leveraging these experiences to develop and disseminate **educational support frameworks, prompt design systems, and the integrated design architecture "Samizo-AITL"**.
