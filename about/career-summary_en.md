## 📘 Career by Phase**

### 🔹 Phase 1: From Control Systems to Semiconductor Devices (1994–2006)
  Started with **control system design using MATLAB/Simulink** and conducted early research on **thin-film microreactors** during his university years.  
  > 🧪 [Thin-Film Microreactor 1996](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/Edusemi-Plus/archive/in1996/thinfilm_microreactor.html)  
  > *Ferrite + Al spiral coil structure, analyzing loss mechanisms at 500 kHz–1 MHz (undergraduate research).*

  In 1997, he joined Seiko Epson, working on **process integration for 0.35μm to 0.18μm logic, memory, and high-voltage CMOS technologies**.  
  *He led complex integration of transistors with different characteristics, handling process design, implementation, and verification.*

  > 🧩 **Episode: 64M DRAM Startup (1998)**  
  > *Led the mass production ramp-up of a 0.25μm-generation DRAM, covering end-to-end process design, defect analysis, and yield improvement.*
