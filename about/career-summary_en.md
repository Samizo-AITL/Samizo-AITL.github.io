## 📘 Career by Phase

### 🔹 Phase 1: From Control Systems to Semiconductor Devices (1994–2006)

Started with **control system design using MATLAB/Simulink** and conducted early research on **thin-film microreactors** during his university years.

> 🧪 **Thin-Film Microreactor Analysis (1996–1997)**  
> Ferrite core + Al spiral coil structure designed for a DCDC converter.  
> Analyzed Q-factor degradation and material choice between Al and Cu in the 500 kHz–1 MHz range.  
> 🔗 [More details › Thin-Film Microreactor 1996](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/Edusemi-Plus/archive/in1996/thinfilm_microreactor.html)

In 1997, he joined Seiko Epson and led **process integration of logic, memory, and high-voltage devices from 0.35μm to 0.18μm generations**.  
He handled the complex coexistence of transistors with differing characteristics, taking charge of design, implementation, and verification.

> 🧩 **Episode: 64M DRAM Startup (1998)**  
> Led the production ramp-up of a 0.25μm-generation DRAM.  
> Responsible for process design, failure analysis, and yield improvement.

### 🔹 Phase 3: Productization of PrecisionCore and Educational Initiatives (2012–)

Played a leading role in advancing **head electronics for PrecisionCore**,  
particularly the **COF-based integration of driver ICs**.  
Simultaneously promoted systems for **BOM standardization, ISO training, and technical legacy handoff**.

---

### 🎯 Current Activities

Currently building and promoting **Samizo-AITL**,  
an open framework for **education, prompt engineering, and AI-integrated control system design**.

> 📌 As part of the initiative, a comprehensive parameter comparison table for FinFET and GAA transistor nodes has been compiled:  
> 👉 [FinFET / GAA Node Parameter Comparison Table](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/Edusemi-v4x/f_chapter1_finfet_gaa/appendixf1_05_node_params)
