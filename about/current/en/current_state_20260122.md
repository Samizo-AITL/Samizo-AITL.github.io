# 🧭 Current State  
## Structural Issues in Physical AI and AI Control Research (as of 2026)

[![Back to Portal (EN)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Back%20to%20Portal-0B5FFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=homeassistant&logoColor=white)](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/portal/en/)

This document summarizes the state of **Physical AI / AI control / robotics** research as of 2026,  
and clarifies the **structural and architectural issues** observed from a system design perspective.

📌 This is not a critique of specific methods or organizations,  
but an attempt to organize current approaches in terms of **responsibility separation, time scales, and stability guarantees**.

## 1️⃣ Background: Why Physical AI Emerged

Recent AI research has increasingly focused on interaction with the **physical world** due to:

- 🤖 **Limitations of LLMs** when detached from real-world dynamics
- 🏭 **Growing demand** in robotics, manufacturing, and mobility systems
- 📡 **Advances in sensing and computational infrastructure**

As a result, concepts such as **Physical AI**, **World Models**, and **end-to-end learned control** have gained attention.

---

## 2️⃣ Overview of Major Approaches

### 2.1 🔁 End-to-End Reinforcement Learning Control
- Single-model mapping from sensors to actuators
- High performance in simulated environments

**⚠ Issues**
- Stability and safety depend on **training outcomes**
- **Fragile** under design changes and degradation

---

### 2.2 🌐 World Models and Foundation Model Extensions
- Large models implicitly encode **environment dynamics**
- Integrated planning, reasoning, and action generation

**⚠ Issues**
- Physical constraints and delays are **implicit**
- Control bandwidth and divergence conditions are **hard to explain**

---

### 2.3 🧮 Model-Based Control with Learning Components
- MPC combined with learned dynamics or policies

**⚠ Issues**
- **Unclear separation** between design-time and run-time responsibilities
- **High implementation and maintenance cost**

---

## 3️⃣ Common Structural Problems

### 3.1 ⏱ Mixed Time Scales
- µs–ms: **real-time stabilization**
- ms–s: **state transitions and mode management**
- Non-real-time: **learning and redesign**

Many current systems attempt to handle all these within a **single learning or inference framework**.

---

### 3.2 ⚖️ Undefined Responsibility for Stability
- Divergence handled by **retraining**
- Safety ensured by **external guards**

From a control engineering perspective,  
this leaves **stability responsibility undefined**.

---

### 3.3 🧱 Weak Position of Physical Models
- Friction, saturation, delays, and nonlinearities **absorbed as data**
- Not explicitly represented as **design knowledge**

This reduces explainability and redesign capability under:
- 📉 degradation
- 💥 failures
- 🔄 condition changes

---

## 4️⃣ Reframing as a Design Problem

These issues are not primarily about AI capability, but about:

> 🧠 **Lack of explicit separation of design responsibilities**

Key questions remain unanswered:
- ❓ Who guarantees stability?
- ❓ Where are state transitions defined?
- ❓ At which time scale is learning permitted?

Without explicit answers, Physical AI systems face inherent limits in **reliability and maintainability**.

---

## 5️⃣ Conclusion

As of 2026, Physical AI and AI control research has:

- 🚀 Achieved impressive learning capabilities, yet
- 🧩 Remains **structurally immature as a system design discipline**

This portal and the **AITL** framework are designed  
**with this recognition as a prerequisite.**

This document serves as a 🧷 **snapshot of that prerequisite understanding**.
