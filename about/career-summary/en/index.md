# 🛠️ Career Summary

This page provides a concise summary of a technical career  
that started with **control theory and electromagnetic field analysis**,  
and expanded through **semiconductor devices, MEMS, and industrial inkjet product development**.

Although the fields involved are diverse, the consistent underlying principle is:

**“Understanding physics, translating it into mechanisms,  
and organizing it into reusable and structured forms.”**
