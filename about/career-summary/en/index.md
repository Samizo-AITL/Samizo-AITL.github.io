# 🛠️ Career Summary

[![Back to Portal (EN)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Back%20to%20Portal-0B5FFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=homeassistant&logoColor=white)](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/portal/en/)

This page provides a concise summary of a technical career  
that started with **control theory and electromagnetic field analysis**,  
and expanded through **semiconductor devices, MEMS, and industrial inkjet product development**.

Although the fields involved are diverse, the consistent underlying principle is:

**“Understanding physics, translating it into mechanisms,  
and organizing it into reusable and structured forms.”**

## 📘 Career Overview (Summary)

### ⚡ Control & Electromagnetic Analysis (–1997)
- Control system design using MATLAB / Simulink
- Graduate-level research in electromagnetic field analysis
- Analysis of thin-film magnetic materials and on-chip passive components

---

### 💾 Semiconductor Device Development (1997–2006)
- Process integration for logic, memory, and high-voltage CMOS  
  in the 0.35–0.18 µm technology generations
- DRAM and PSRAM mass production ramp-up, yield improvement, and failure analysis
- Development and practical deployment of high-voltage mixed CMOS  
  for a-TFT driver IC applications

---

### 🎛️ Thin-Film Piezoelectric Actuators (2007–2012)
- Expansion from FeRAM PZT process evaluation  
  to thin-film piezoelectric actuator development
- Structural analysis, reliability evaluation, and defect countermeasures  
  for mass-production readiness
- Contribution to the foundation of Inkjet Print Head technology

---

### 🖨️ Inkjet Head Productization & Technical Education (2012– )
- Mass production deployment of Inkjet printheads,  
  focusing on COF driver IC implementation and electrical design
- Responsibility for quality, parts management, and scheduling  
  from development through mass production
- Development and organization-wide deployment of educational materials  
  covering BOM operation, ISO concepts, and technical knowledge transfer

---

## 🎯 Current Activities
- Development of structured educational content  
  spanning semiconductors, control systems, and inkjet technologies
- Operation and maintenance of open educational resources such as  
  Edusemi, SemiDevKit, and EduController
- Use of AI and LLMs **not as replacements for design or control**,  
  but as tools to support thinking, structuring, and design assistance
