# 🛠️ Career Summary

[![Back to Portal (EN)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Back%20to%20Portal-0B5FFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=homeassistant&logoColor=white)](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/portal/en/)

This page provides a concise summary of a technical career  
that started with **control theory and electromagnetic field analysis**,  
and expanded through **semiconductor devices, MEMS, and industrial inkjet product development**.

Although the fields involved are diverse, the consistent underlying principle is:

**“Understanding physics, translating it into mechanisms,  
and organizing it into reusable and structured forms.”**

  from development through mass production
- Development and organization-wide deployment of educational materials  
  covering BOM operation, ISO concepts, and technical knowledge transfer

---

## 🎯 Current Activities
- Development of structured educational content  
  spanning semiconductors, control systems, and inkjet technologies
- Operation and maintenance of open educational resources such as  
  Edusemi, SemiDevKit, and EduController
- Use of AI and LLMs **not as replacements for design or control**,  
  but as tools to support thinking, structuring, and design assistance

## 🧠 Technical Archive

This archive organizes the **decision-making frameworks** used throughout my career in  
manufacturing technology, reliability design, and technical judgment,  
based on **abstracted non-public materials**.

- Focuses on *thinking structures*, not implementations  
- Contains no proprietary data, values, or product-specific details
