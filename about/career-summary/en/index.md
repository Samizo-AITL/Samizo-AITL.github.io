### 🔹 Phase 1: Semiconductor Devices (1997–2006)

- **1997**: Joined Seiko Epson.  
  Led process integration for **logic, memory, and high-voltage devices** in the 0.35 µm–0.18 µm generations.  
  Responsible for cross-device integration from process design to verification.

> 🧩 **Episode: 64 M DRAM Ramp-Up (1998)**  
> Contributed to the 0.25 µm DRAM mass production startup, focusing on defect analysis and yield improvement.

### 🔹 Phase 2: PZT Materials and Actuator Development (2007–2012)

- Transitioned from FeRAM-oriented PZT process evaluation to developing **thin-film piezoelectric actuators**.  
- Contributed to **structural analysis and reliability assurance** of PZT films, forming the technological basis for PrecisionCore printhead development.  
- Addressed thin-film-specific reliability issues by analyzing defect causes in PZT formation and optimizing surface treatment processes,  
  leading to significant improvements in mechanical durability and manufacturability.
