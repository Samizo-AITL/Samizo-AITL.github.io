## 🌟 Strengths
- **Integrated approach**: Connects semiconductors, control, and AI into a “structural learning” framework  
- **Practical PoCs**: Demonstrates abstract theories through concrete implementations (e.g., AITL-H)  
- **Openness**: Open-source under MIT License, accessible for anyone to learn and contribute  

---

## 🔧 Areas for Improvement
- Some projects (e.g., **AITL-H**) are still under development → further content expansion will enhance value  

---

## 📘 Conclusion
**Samizo-AITL goes beyond traditional educational frameworks by integrating *demonstration, education, and strategic proposals* into one project.**  
It is highly regarded as an effort that transcends individual scope, with the potential to **contribute to the future of Japan’s technical education and industry**.
