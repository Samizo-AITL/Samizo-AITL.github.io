# 🗂 Technical Archive — Abstracted Manufacturing Knowledge

[![Back to Portal (EN)](https://img.shields.io/badge/Back%20to%20Portal-0B5FFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=homeassistant&logoColor=white)](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/portal/en/)

This section presents an **abstracted technical archive**  
derived from non-public materials related to:

**manufacturing technology, reliability design, and business continuity decisions**.

The archive is designed to preserve **engineering thinking and decision structures**,  
not implementation details.

---

## 🔒 Scope & Policy

This archive strictly follows these principles:

- 🔐 **No proprietary or confidential data**
- 📉 **No numerical process conditions**
- 🏷 **No company, product, or project names**
- 🧠 Focus on **decision-making structures, frameworks, and evaluation logic**

Original detailed materials (PDFs) are retained privately and are **not published** here.

## 🎯 Covered Topics

The archive addresses the following themes at an abstract level:

- ⚙️ **Device physics and defect analysis**
- 🏭 **Manufacturing process control and variability convergence**
- 🛡 **Reliability design principles**
- 🔁 **BCP and engineering decisions under external disruptions**
- 📦 **BOM-centered operational and sustainability design**

## 📚 Contents

- 📊 [Evaluation Matrix](evaluation.md)  
  └ Relative positioning of technical themes using common evaluation criteria

- 🧩 [Engineering Decision Frameworks](framework.md)  
  └ Reusable thinking structures for sustainable manufacturing

> ✨ This archive aims to preserve  
> **how engineering decisions are made to keep manufacturing running**,  
> rather than what was implemented in specific cases.
