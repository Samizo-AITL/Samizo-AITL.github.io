## 🧠 Concept: Cross-Disciplinary Integration

The **Samizo-AITL** initiative aims to build an **integrated technical architecture** across domains:

- **Semiconductor × Control Theory × Mechanical Design × AI × Educational Engineering**
- **GPT/LLM-assisted** support for design, education, and implementation  
  (Note: AI is used for structural drafting support, but all content is authored and validated by Shinichi Samizo)
- All content (**curricula**, **PoCs**, **templates**) is published under the **MIT License**

> 💡 **[Edusemi-v4x](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/Edusemi-v4x/)** serves as a **core curriculum** based on real-world engineering experience.
