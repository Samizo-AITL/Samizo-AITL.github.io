# 🎓 Samizo-AITL Portal

**A physical-first engineering archive  
that explains *why* systems can be designed the way they are.**

[![Japanese Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Japanese-Version-brightgreen?logo=github)](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/)

---

## 🧭 What this is
**AITL (Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic)** is a  
**physical-first engineering archive** that integrates  
physics, devices, control, and intelligence  
through a **single causal structure**.

Rather than collecting isolated techniques,  
this portal focuses on **why systems behave and are designed as they are**,  
by organizing engineering knowledge as explicit causal relationships  
between physical quantities, control logic, and design decisions.

---

## 👤 Who this is for
- **Engineers in semiconductors, MEMS, control, and AI**
- Those who care about **design rationale**, not just implementation details
- People interested in **cross-domain, design-oriented thinking**

## 📌 Notes
This portal is intended as:
- a technical knowledge archive,
- a design explanation resource,
- and a cross-domain reference for engineers.

All materials are written with **practical engineering explanation, design review,  
and technical education** in mind.
