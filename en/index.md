# 🎓 Samizo-AITL Portal

[![Japanese Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Japanese-Version-brightgreen?logo=github)](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/)

---

## 🧭 What this is
A **physical-first engineering archive** that connects  
devices, control, and intelligent systems  
through a **single causal structure**.

Rather than collecting isolated techniques,  
this portal focuses on **why systems can be designed the way they are**  
by organizing knowledge as causal relationships.

---

## 👤 Who this is for
- **Engineers in semiconductors, MEMS, control, and AI**
- Those who care about **why systems behave as they do**, not just implementation
- People interested in **design-oriented, cross-domain thinking**
