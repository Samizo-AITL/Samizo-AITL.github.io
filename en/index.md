## 🧠 Concept: Cross-Disciplinary Integration

The **Samizo-AITL** initiative aims to build an integrated architecture across disciplines:

- Semiconductor × Control Theory × Mechanical Design × AI × Educational Engineering  
- GPT/LLM-assisted support for design, learning, and implementation  
  <br><br><em>Note: GPT is used as a support tool; all content is structured and verified by the author.</em>  
- All content (curricula, PoCs, templates) is released under the MIT License

> 💡 [Edusemi-v4x](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/Edusemi-v4x/) serves as a core curriculum based on real-world engineering experience.
