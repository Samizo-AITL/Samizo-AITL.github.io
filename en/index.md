## 📘 Edusemi v4.x — Integrated Semiconductor Education

An open-source teaching framework for semiconductor technology, ideal for **KOSEN**, **university**, and **corporate training**.

▶︎ [Edusemi GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Samizo-AITL/Edusemi-v4x)

| Module     | Key Topics |
|------------|------------|
| Basics     | Semiconductor physics, logic circuits, MOS/SoC design, testing |
| Applied    | High-voltage, ESD, layout, analog, PDK-based design |
| Practical  | Sky130 + OpenLane design, Python automation, PoC workflows |
| Advanced   | FinFET/GAA, chiplets, FSM×PID×LLM-based SoC integration |

## 🎛️ EduController — Control Theory Meets AI

**EduController** is a structured learning toolkit that bridges classical control, modern control, and AI-based controllers.  
It includes hands-on simulations and design exercises using Python.

▶︎ [EduController GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Samizo-AITL/EduController)

> 📚 Currently under development with 9 chapters: 5 for control theory, 4 for AI control.

| Track             | Topics |
|------------------|--------|
| 🎓 Control Theory | PID, state-space, robust control, digital implementation |
| 🤖 AI Control     | Neural networks, reinforcement learning, data-driven control, LLM integration |

## 🤖 AITL-H — Hybrid Intelligent Control Architecture

**AITL-H (All-in-Theory Logic - Hybrid)** proposes a 3-layer intelligent control model for robotics and adaptive systems:

- 🧠 FSM = Instinct (discrete state logic)  
- 🎯 PID = Rational control (physics-based feedback)  
- 💬 LLM = Intelligence (language-guided intent estimation)

▶︎ [AITL-H GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Samizo-AITL/AITL-H)  
▶︎ [AITL-H PoC Documentation](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/AITL-H/#/)

This architecture targets applications in disaster response, elderly care, and self-adaptive learning.  
Low-level SoC integration (RTL-to-GDSII) is covered in the **Edusemi v4.x Advanced Module**.

## 🎮 Rekiden — ChatGPT-Driven Historical Simulation

**Rekiden** is a markdown-based simulation game where players assume the roles of historical figures in Japanese history.  
Through conversation with ChatGPT, you make choices in scenarios like the Sengoku or Bakumatsu periods — exploring rich alternate histories.

▶︎ [Rekiden README (English)](https://github.com/Samizo-AITL/Rekiden/blob/main/README_en.md)

| Feature               | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🤖 ChatGPT Game Master | GPT acts as a dynamic storyteller and branching logic engine               |
| 📄 Markdown Scenarios  | Transparent and editable scenario files                                     |
| 🎓 Learning-Oriented   | Encourages historical thinking, diplomacy, and ethical reasoning            |
| 🗺️ Globally Accessible  | All scenarios and logic will be available in English and Japanese          |
