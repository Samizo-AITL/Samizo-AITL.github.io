## 🧠 **Concept: Cross-Disciplinary Integration**

The **Samizo-AITL** initiative is based on a vision of **technical integration across disciplines**, combining:

- **Semiconductor × Control Theory × Mechanical Design × AI × Educational Engineering**
- **GPT/LLM-assisted support** for **design**, **learning**, and **implementation**  
  <br><br>*Note: GPT is used for assisted structuring. Final validation and authorship are handled entirely by the creator.*
- All projects and materials are released under the **MIT License**

> 💡 **[Edusemi-v4x](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/Edusemi-v4x/)** is the **core educational platform** based on **real-world industry experience**.
