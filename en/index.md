## 🧩 Design Intent and Integration Philosophy

This portal aims to embody a **cross-disciplinary integration architecture**, combining:

- Semiconductor technology × Control theory × Mechanical design × AI × Educational technology  
- Support for design, learning, and implementation through ChatGPT/LLM integration  
- All materials, PoC frameworks, and templates are provided under the MIT License

> 💡 [Edusemi](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/Edusemi-v4x/) serves as the core curriculum based on real-world experience.
