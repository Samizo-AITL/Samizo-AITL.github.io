## 🧭 What this is
**AITL (Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic)** is a  
**physical-first engineering archive** that integrates  
devices, control, and intelligence  
through a **single causal structure**.

Rather than collecting isolated techniques,  
this portal focuses on **why systems can be designed the way they are**  
by organizing engineering knowledge as causal relationships.

---

## 👤 Who this is for
- **Engineers in semiconductors, MEMS, control, and AI**
- Those who care about **why systems behave as they do**, not just implementation
- People interested in **design-oriented, cross-domain thinking**
