## 🧭 What is Samizo-AITL?

The **Samizo-AITL Portal**, created by **Shinichi Samizo**, is a  
**design-oriented technical archive** that reorganizes semiconductor devices, MEMS, and control engineering  
around a **shared physical foundation**.

Rather than explaining individual technologies in isolation,  
this portal presents engineering systems through a **single causal structure**:

**Physics → Structure → Devices → Process → Models → Systems → Control → Intelligence**

The goal is to enable readers to **reconstruct design decisions**  
while preserving physical meaning, constraints, and causality.

---

## 🎯 Intended Audience

Samizo-AITL is intended for engineers and researchers who:

- Design systems **starting from physical models and constraints**
- Use AI / LLMs as **supervisory, analytical, or redesign layers**, not as black-box controllers
- Seek **cross-disciplinary understanding without collapsing causality**

This portal is **not an introductory tutorial**.  
It is a **structural reference for design-oriented engineering work**.

---

## 🧠 Positioning of Intelligence (AITL)

AI, control theory, and LLM-based technologies are **not treated as standalone solutions**.

They are positioned as:

> **The outermost layer that enables correct and complete utilization of physical models.**

The system architecture is viewed as a **layered structure**:

- **Inner layers**: Physics, devices, MEMS (constraint-defining layers)  
- **Middle layers**: System modeling and classical control theory  
- **Outer layers**: Intelligence, adaptation, and redesign  

This layered concept is referred to as  
**AITL — Adaptive Intelligent Technology Loop**.

LLMs are explicitly placed **outside the real-time control loop**,  
serving as tools for supervision, diagnosis, and redesign.

---

## 🗺 How to Read This Portal

The portal is designed to be explored in the following order:

1. **Design philosophy and architecture**  
   → Physical-first engineering and AITL structure  
2. **Main Core (physical foundations)**  
   → Semiconductor devices, MEMS, and physical constraints  
3. **Applied Layer (control and intelligence)**  
   → Roles of PID, FSM, and LLMs  
4. **Proof-of-concept implementations**  
   → Verification through working systems

Recommended flow:

**Philosophy → Physics → Control → Intelligence**

This avoids tool-driven or fragmented understanding.

# 🎛 Applied Layer — Control & Intelligence

This layer explores how physical foundations are applied to  
**dynamic systems and control problems**.

Classical control (PID, FSM) remains the **primary control mechanism**,  
while AI/LLMs are treated as **architectural support tools**, not replacements.

---

## 4️⃣ EduController
An educational resource focused on **control fundamentals**:

- PID control principles  
- FSM-based supervisory logic  
- Control-oriented design thinking  
- Optional HDL template generation

## 5️⃣ AITL-Controller-A-Type
A **minimal experimental controller** implemented in Python to explore:

- Separation of control (PID)  
- Supervision and decision logic (FSM)  
- Redesign and analysis support (LLM)

This project is a **thinking framework**,  
not a proposal for a new control algorithm.
