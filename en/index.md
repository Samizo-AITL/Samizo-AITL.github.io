## 🧠 Concept: Cross-Disciplinary Integration

The **Samizo-AITL** initiative aims to build an integrated technical architecture across disciplines:

- Semiconductor × Control Theory × Mechanical Design × AI × Educational Engineering  
- GPT/LLM-powered design, learning, and implementation support  
- All content (curricula, PoCs, templates) is available under the **MIT License**

> 💡 [Edusemi](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/Edusemi-v4x/) serves as a foundational curriculum built on industry experience.
