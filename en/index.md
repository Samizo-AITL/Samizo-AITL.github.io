description: Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic — a physical-first engineering archive

# 🎓 Samizo-AITL Portal
**A physical-first engineering archive  
that explains *why* systems can be designed the way they are —  
and how they ultimately return to the physical world.**

> ✅ **AI never replaces real-time control — it is restricted to design-time supervision**  
> ✅ **Engineering begins with physical quantities, not abstract optimization**  
> ✅ **Design logic must be reusable, explainable, and reviewable**

## ⚡ 60-second orientation
If this is your first visit, start with the architecture overview.

- **Recommended first** → [**portal(en)**](/portal/en/)  
- **Semiconductor / device engineers** → [**Edusemi-v4x(en)**](/Edusemi-v4x/en/)  
- **Control / AI engineers** → [**EduController(en)**](/EduController/en/)

## 🧭 What this is
**AITL (Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic)** is a  
**physical-first engineering archive** that integrates  
physics, devices, control, and intelligence  
through a **single causal structure**.

Rather than collecting isolated techniques,  
this portal focuses on **why systems behave and are designed as they are**,  
by organizing engineering knowledge as explicit causal relationships  
between **physical quantities, control logic, and design decisions**.

---

## 🧠 Core design principle: role separation
AITL is built on **clear separation of responsibility**.

- **PID (inner loop)**  
  Real-time stability and performance

- **FSM (supervisory layer)**  
  Mode selection, state transitions, and safety-oriented control

- **AI / LLM (outer layer)**  
  Non-real-time **design support**, such as  
  gain re-identification, model updates, and rule refinement

> AI supports *redesign and supervision* —  
> it does not replace deterministic control loops.

---

## 👤 Who this is for
- **Engineers in semiconductors, MEMS, control, and AI**
- Those who care about **design rationale and explainability**
- People interested in **cross-domain, system-level thinking**

> This is not an introductory tutorial site.  
> It is an archive for **explainable, reviewable engineering design**.

## ✅ What you gain from this portal
- **Explainable design**: clear links from physics to control performance  
- **Reusable logic**: architectures, not ad-hoc techniques  
- **Correct placement of AI** in engineering systems

## 📌 Notes
This portal is intended as:
- a technical knowledge archive,
- a design explanation resource,
- and a cross-domain reference for engineers.

All materials are written with **practical engineering explanation,  
design review, and technical education** in mind.
