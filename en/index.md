# 🎓 Samizo-AITL Portal
> **"Read the structure, create the motion, accelerate with AI"** — *A portal for learning the fusion of physics and intelligence*

[![Hybrid License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Hybrid-blueviolet)](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/Edusemi-v4x/#-ライセンス--license)

**Samizo-AITL Portal** is a personal project by **Shinichi Samizo**.  
Focusing on **Semiconductors × Control × AI**, it systematically organizes and connects fragments of knowledge, phenomena, and technologies to support **education**, **PoC (Proof of Concept)**, and **policy proposals**.

While conversational AI such as ChatGPT is mainstream today,  
I believe the next trend will be **"Physical AI"** — AI directly linked to physical phenomena and structures.

Samizo-AITL is built upon both "hands-on operational experience" and "structural analysis expertise",  
developing education, PoC, and conceptual frameworks for **using AI in motion rather than just in words**.

## 🧠 **Background of the AITL Integrated Concept**

**Samizo-AITL** organically connects **Semiconductors × Control × AI**,  
integrating the process of **analyzing physical structures, validating through PoC, and supporting design with AI** into education, concept development, and engineering.

> 📘 All materials and PoC examples in this project group are released under the **MIT License**. While AI tools such as ChatGPT are used as assistants, the overall structure, verification, and writing responsibility lie entirely with the author.  
{: .annotation-narrow}

> 💡 The core curriculum [**Edusemi-v4x**](https://samizo-aitl.github.io/Edusemi-v4x/en/) is reconstructed from the author's professional experience and research, and is unrelated to any specific commercial product or company activity.

Would you like me to continue and include the **Core Materials Table**, **Policy & Collaboration**, **Supplementary Docs**, **Author Info**, and **Career Summary** in English as well so this matches the Japanese version exactly?  
This will make the English version a full one-to-one counterpart.
