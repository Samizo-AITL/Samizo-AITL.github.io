## 🧭 What this is
**AITL (Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic)** is a  
**physical-first engineering archive** that integrates  
physics, devices, control, and intelligence  
into a **single, explainable causal architecture**.

Rather than collecting isolated techniques or algorithms,  
this portal focuses on **why systems can be designed the way they are**,  
by organizing engineering knowledge as **causal relationships**  
from physical behavior to design decisions.

---

## 👤 Who this is for
- **Engineers in semiconductors, MEMS, control, and AI**
- Those who care about **why systems behave as they do**, not just implementation details
- People interested in **design-oriented, cross-domain engineering thinking**

  *Overall structure of AITL, causal architecture, and design philosophy*

- ▶ ⚙️ **Semiconductor-first path**  
  → [/Edusemi-v4x/](/Edusemi-v4x/)  
  *Physics-, process-, and device-oriented design logic*

- ▶ 🤖 **Control & AI path**  
  → [/EduController/](/EduController/)  
  *Roles of PID, FSM, and LLM in system architectures.  
  AI does **not** operate in real-time control loops;  
  it is used exclusively for **design-time explanation, evaluation,  
  and architectural redesign**.*

## 🔑 Core principle
In AITL, **control systems and AI are never conflated**.

- Control systems ensure **stability and performance** based on physical models
- AI is used to **explain design rationale**,  
  **analyze causal structure**, and  
  **support architectural redesign**

AITL is **not** a control method,  
**not** a learning algorithm,  
and **not** an AI-in-the-loop framework.

It is a **design architecture** for integrating technology  
with clear causal and logical boundaries.

---

## 📌 In one sentence
**AITL is an architecture for explaining and designing engineering systems  
through integrated technology logic, grounded in physics and causality.**
