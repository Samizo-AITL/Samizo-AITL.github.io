# 🎓 Samizo-AITL Portal
**A physical-first engineering archive  
that connects physics, devices, control, and intelligence  
through explicit causal structure.**

## 🧭 What this is
**AITL (Architecture for Integrated Technology Logic)** is a framework for organizing  
engineering knowledge as **causal relationships** linking  
physical quantities, device behavior, control logic, and system performance.

Rather than presenting isolated methods,  
this portal focuses on **how design decisions arise from physical constraints**  
and how those decisions propagate through control and system architecture.

## 🧠 Design structure
AITL organizes control and intelligence by role.

- **PID (real-time control layer)**  
  Stability, response, and disturbance rejection based on physical models

- **FSM (supervisory layer)**  
  State transitions, mode selection, and safety-oriented logic

- **AI / LLM (non-real-time layer)**  
  Support for design-time tasks such as  
  model updates, gain re-identification, and rule refinement

AI is treated as a **design support layer**,  
not as a replacement for deterministic control loops.

## 👤 Intended audience
- Engineers working with physics-based systems  
  (semiconductors, MEMS, control, AI)
- Those interested in **design rationale and causal explanation**
- Readers looking to organize engineering knowledge across domains
