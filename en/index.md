# Samizo-AITL Portal

## What this is
A **physical-first engineering archive** that connects  
devices, control, and intelligent systems  
through a **single causal structure**.

## Who this is for
- Engineers in semiconductors, MEMS, control, and AI
- Those who care about *why systems behave*, not just implementation

## Start here
- ▶ **Architecture & philosophy** → [/portal/en/](/portal/en/)
- ▶ **Semiconductor-first path** → [/Edusemi-v4x/](/Edusemi-v4x/)
- ▶ **Control & AI path** → [/EduController/](/EduController/)
