# 🎓 Samizo-AITL Portal 

> "Read the structure, create the motion, accelerate with AI" – A portal for learning the fusion of physics and intelligence

**Samizo-AITL Portal** is a personal project by **Shinichi Samizo**,  
aimed at **systematically organizing and connecting fragmented knowledge, technologies, and physical phenomena**  
across the fields of **Semiconductors × Control × AI**.

While today’s AI trend is dominated by tools like **ChatGPT** (conversational AI),  
I believe the next wave will be driven by **“Physical AI”**—AI that is tightly integrated with physical structures and phenomena.

Samizo-AITL is built on both real-world manufacturing experience and structural analysis,  
focusing on **education, PoC (Proof of Concept), and strategy proposals**  
to develop AI that is not just linguistic—but functional, observable, and controllable in physical systems.
