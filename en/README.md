# 🎓 Samizo-AITL Portal
> *"Read structures, create dynamics, accelerate with AI" — A portal for learning the fusion of physics and intelligence*

The **Samizo-AITL Portal** is a personal project by **Shinichi Samizo**.  

This project focuses on **Semiconductors × Control × AI**,  
structurally organizing and connecting fragments of knowledge, phenomena, and technologies,  
to be applied to **education, proofs-of-concept (PoCs), and policy proposals**.  

While **conversational AI** such as ChatGPT is mainstream today,  
the next frontier is **"Physical AI"** — intelligence directly tied to physical phenomena and structures.  

Samizo-AITL, built on experience in both **practical implementation** and **structural analysis**,  
develops **education, PoCs, and strategic visions** to use AI **not only through words, but through physical actions**.

## 🚩 Flagship PoC: Humanoid Robot Control

> ⚠️ **Note**  
> This figure is a **conceptual diagram for educational and PoC purposes**.  
> - **Stability and response design rely on control theory (e.g., PID)**.  
> - **FSM and LLM act as outer supervisory/support layers**, not part of the stability-guaranteed loop.  
> - Node choices and performance depictions are **illustrative / work-in-progress** and may change with further validation.  
> - **No confidential information is included**; it is based on public information, fundamental principles, and the author’s own experience.

This figure illustrates the **culmination of the Samizo-AITL project**, showcasing the Proof of Concept for humanoid robot control.  
It integrates a **cross-node design** spanning 22nm SoC, 0.18µm AMS, 0.35µm LDMOS, and energy harvesting,  
with a three-layer architecture of **LLM, FSM, and physical control**.
