## 🧩 ChatGPT Utilization Maturity Checklist (v1.0)

| Category | Item | Status | Example / Note |
|----------|------|--------|----------------|
| **1. Basic Usage** | Using ChatGPT for one-shot questions and knowledge queries | ✅ | Used to look up definitions, history, comparisons |
|  | Utilizing ChatGPT to summarize and organize multi-perspective content | ✅ | Converts long texts into tables, chapters, or bullet points |
| **2. Prompt Engineering** | Designing structured prompt templates | ✅ | e.g., SemiTechBot and Asset analysis templates |
|  | Embedding logic and conditional structures (like `if` statements) | ✅ | Used in FSM design, Rekiden branching scenarios |
|  | Defining input/output clearly for reusable prompt templates | ✅ | For API integration or macro use |
| **3. Application Domains** | Applying ChatGPT to educational content development | ✅ | Edusemi, EduController, EduMecha, etc. |
|  | Applying to technical domains like control systems, design, semiconductors | ✅ | AITL-H architecture, Inkjet documentation |
|  | Applying to non-technical domains such as finance/investment | ✅ | AssetPortfolio project and templates |
| **4. GitHub / Integration** | Publishing templates or educational projects on GitHub | ✅ | SamizoGPT repositories under MIT license |
|  | Developing tools using ChatGPT API (e.g., Flask integration) | ✅ | SemiTechBot with Flask + ChatGPT API |
|  | Exploring GUI or scenario engine integration (e.g., Streamlit) | △ | Streamlit version of Rekiden is under consideration |
| **5. Design Partnership** | Using ChatGPT as a design discussion partner | ✅ | For control systems, FSMs, PoC specification |
|  | Developing LLM-integrated system architecture | ✅ | AITL-H hybrid architecture (FSM + PID + LLM) |
|  | Using ChatGPT for specification reviews and improvement suggestions | △ | PoC review templates can be further enhanced |
| **6. Documentation Practice** | Organizing technical info in Markdown format | ✅ | Across Edusemi, Inkjet, Asset, and others |
|  | Using Mermaid.js or similar for visual diagrams | ✅ | FSM structure, control architecture, inkjet diagrams |
|  | Preparing for international publishing in English | △ | README translations and multilingual content planned |
